# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The RRM Web API follows Clean Architecture principles, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability. The solution is structured into multiple layers, each with specific responsibilities.

## Solution Structure

### 1. Domain Layer (RRM.Domain)
- Contains enterprise business rules
- Entities and value objects
- Domain events
- Repository interfaces
- Domain services interfaces

### 2. Application Layer (RRM.Application)
- Application business rules
- Use cases and application services
- DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
- Interfaces for external services
- Validation logic

### 3. Infrastructure Layer (RRM.Infrastructure)
- Data access implementation
- External service implementations
- Email services
- File storage
- Caching
- Logging

### 4. Web API Layer (RRM.WebApi)
- Controllers
- Middleware
- Authentication/Authorization
- API documentation
- Request/Response models

### 5. Shared Layer (RRM.Shared)
- Common utilities
- Cross-cutting concerns
- Shared models
- Extension methods

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern
- Abstracts data access
- Provides collection-like interface
- Decouples business logic from data access

### Unit of Work
- Manages transactions
- Ensures data consistency
- Groups multiple operations

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Separates read and write operations
- Optimizes for different use cases
- Improves scalability

### Mediator Pattern
- Decouples request handling
- Simplifies controller logic
- Improves testability

## Security

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization
- Input validation
- CORS configuration
- HTTPS enforcement

## Testing Strategy

- Unit Tests: Test individual components
- Integration Tests: Test component interactions
- API Tests: Test HTTP endpoints
- Database Tests: Test data access
- Security Tests: Test authentication/authorization

## Deployment

- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline
- Environment-specific configurations
- Health checks
- Monitoring and logging
